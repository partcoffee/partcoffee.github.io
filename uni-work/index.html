Stressful? Yes. Bad move? Maybe, but I learned a lot from doing it!</p> <p>In Q4 of 2014, I got an email from an agency north of Winchester. Apparently I had been recommended, and they were interested in employing me as a designer/web developer for their medium sized bespoke software company. I went to an interview, and a month and a half later I’m working with Illustrator, InDesign, PHP, LESS and a variety of prototyping tools.</p> <blockquote class="entry"> <p>Short version:<br />It's great!</p> </blockquote> <p>The majority of the projects I’m working on are protected by a non disclosure agreement, but I can talk about the experience itself. I’ve decided to examine my learned outcomes by looking at four key aspects:</p> <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2> <p>Teamwork has been emphasised at university, but I found it very different in a “real world” setting. Each and every individual on the team wants to be there — they love what they do and they gladly accept challenges. If something is not good enough, someone will speak up and we’ll do it again. Client budget and priority is always something to keep in mind, but everything is completed to a certain standard.</p> <p>Being the new guy on the team presents you with certain challenges. I had times where I couldn’t complete a task because I simply didn’t know how. This was primarily related to technology, but the open communication in the team let me learn instead of being dismissed and put on something else. I really enjoyed this aspect of the team, and I contributed as well with my knowledge in Emmet, Sass and best practises in web development and design.</p> <h2 id="technology">Technology</h2> <p>I joined a team who had predefined preferences for software and languages. I was familiar with them and their existence, but hardly experienced enough. Coming from a background of relatively static sites, the jump into complicated build-systems, content management systems and unfamiliar preprocessors was intimidating at first. It was definitely outside my comfort zone, but that’s how you learn; by simply expanding that zone.</p> <h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2> <p>The initial agreement was Monday, Wednesday and Friday every week — with flexibility for deadlines at university. It quickly turned into one or two days a week, as well as working remotely. I based the initial agreement on my past experience with university work, which was, in hindsight, not very accurate for this semester.</p> <p>From this, I have learned how important flexibility is, and the company has been kind enough to let me work when I can, instead of working full days and playing catch-up on university assignments through the night and weekends.</p> <h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2> <p>University is a safe environment, where you are free to experiment with technology, make mistakes and learn from said mistakes. In industry, there is little to no place for that. If I’m asked to develop a Wordpress theme, I better develop a Wordpress theme in a timely manner. As a new employee, I’m certainly not expected to be the best developer or designer on the team. Quite the opposite actually, but I believe my hunger for knowledge and learning was expected and appreciated.</p> <p>To summarise: I’m enjoying the work. It’s certainly challenging at times, but I appreciate the opportunity and privilege of having work placement alongside university.</p> </article> <footer> <a href="/uni/" class="nxt"> Other University projects </a> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee" target="_blank">GitHub</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="http://instagram.com/magnusskare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="mailto:website.magnusskare@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a> </li> <li> <a href="/">Copyright 2015 Magnus Skare</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/partcoffee.github.io/commits/master" target="_blank">Revised: 05 Apr 2015</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src='../js/main.js'></script> </div> </div>
