Get sketching
-

So now you've got a sketchbook &mdash; or at least a pen and some paper. That's the simplicity of sketching, it really doesn't take much more than that. It's a direct connect between you and that snug brain of yours.

Now, I'm not saying you have to sketch something every day &mdash; do it because you want to and because you benefit from it, not because I tell you to. Once you have the right mindset and motivation, you can start to fill it up in four simple steps:

* Skip page one, blank pages are scary
* Skip page two as well, just to be sure
* Take it with you everywhere
* Sketch every creative thought

Before we go any further, I should mention that bringing your sketchbook everywhere is a bit of a bold statement. I don't mean literally everywhere, but wherever it's appropriate &mdash; like public transport, dull lunch breaks, or when Netflix starts to buffer. You don't even have to limit yourself to a single sketchbook, so you can pretty much have them everywhere.

Explore
-

As with any form of research, this is also a journey and you're exploring potential paths &mdash; and at the same time you're laying the foundation for your own product. A solid foundation is important, but remember to keep it light. To cite Mr. Draplin in the video from <a href="https://vimeo.com/113751583" target="_blank">Lynda</a> below:

Experiment
-

Try experimenting with different thoughts and directions, you might stumble upon some great stuff. Have this long list of things to kickstart your new sketchbook! Draw it or write it &mdash; whatever's most fun and/or convenient for you:

* Wireframes
* Layouts
* To-do lists
* Recipes or things you ought to try out
* Let people remix your sketch by putting it online (Paper's <a href="https://mix.fiftythree.com/" target="_blank">Mix</a> community is a great place to start)

<img src="../img/sketchbook/img_09.jpg" alt="Facial expressions" class="cover big">

* Draw a face &mdash; try to capture a full life story in a single facial expression
* Dreams from last night, yesteryear or the future
* People you find interesting
* Yourself, just really fit

However you choose to sketch, don't focus on picture perfect outcomes. That's not the point of sketching. If you're sketching to become better at drawing, then more power to you, but we're essentially exploring &mdash; it's supposed to be an adventure for you and your imagination. It will benefit you in the long run.

I will leave you to it, but next time we will do a real life example of the exploration-process!
