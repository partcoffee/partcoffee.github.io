    <h1 id="exhibition-branding">Exhibition Branding</h1>

<p>Transmedia is an annual student exhibition by the Digital Media students at Winchester University. The event aims to kickstart their careers in the digital media industry, as well as offering the second years the opportunity to arrange and host the event.</p>

<p>When I was offered to chose my own role within the project I something something went for the website, along with a Conor Cresswell (link?). As a digital media course, the design and quality of the website would heavily affect the rest of the End of Year Show brand.</p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>With a new set up people hosting the event every year, consistent branding has been possible, yet not introduced. Therefore, we very much had a blank canvas to work with. The challenge was to make the design satisfy the students as well as the people we wanted to have at the event – that’s industry btw. The theme for this year: Augmented reality</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Develop a strong brand and website based on augmented reality and student personalities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brand was developed with a friend and fellow student of mine. The initial process was aimed at industry, yet too professional and corporate according to our first feedback session. Looking back, I agree. Good design should be innovative, and this definitely wasn’t it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important feedback was based around being playful. We took this quite literally, but somehow our peers seemed to enjoy it. The site was completed within a couple of months, ready to be launched quite early. We merely had to wait for more content to arrive for us to flesh out, as well as confirmation on date, venue and VIPs.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>(Sketches, key illustrations and whatnot.) I was in charge of the code behind the site, and had to make a few key decisions based on what we needed. These were, primarily, choice of framework, language, browser support and key focus.</p>

<p>As for the framework, I went with a personal one (link). It’s not as extensive as Foundation or Bootstrap, but a lot lighter and open. It’s merely a reset and a grid system with a few mixins. This was ideal as we had a lot of time to make the site, and the primary feature of Foundation and Bootstrap (speed) was not really an issue. The framework is coded in Sass.</p>

<p>Browser support – IE9+ mostly due to our target: design agencies and professionals. Graceful downgrading is obviously included.  Add something about colours, typography, icons, imagery, animations, legibility and such.</p>

<p>This is the in-depth version. Do more like this on your “portfolio” page - http://pictogram.agency/nilas/ Something about the final outcome. What did you learn, what would you do differently? Talk statistics? Analytics? Plans for the future.</p>
