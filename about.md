My name is Magnus Skare. I was born and raised in Northern Norway, and I'm currently working and studying in Winchester, UK. I'm a designer of sorts, but I also enjoy the code that goes behind it - so product/UX designer sounds about right.

This website is where I share thoughts, ideas, ongoing projects and work. Consider it my professional playground.

## Workflow

For web, I'm a fan of a simple sketch followed by development. I like to keep up on new web trends, but I prefer not to be dictated by them.

As for development, I stick to a few powerful tools:

* Sublime Text
* Sass
* Node
* Git

## Ideals

* Simplify
