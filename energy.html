    <h1>Energy</h1>

    <p>Climate change is becoming an ever increasing threat and fuel bills are rising.</p>

    <p>Our reliance on imported energy continues to grow. The UK is committed to achieving an 80 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. To address these challenges we all need to reduce our energy consumption and accelerate a move to sustainable, low carbon lifestyles. These measures can help to reduce your businesses energy consumption and lower energy costs.</p>

    <h1>Solar panels</h1>

    <p>Solar panel electricity systems, also known as Photovoltaics, capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. Installing this system is expensive with a payback period of 10 to 30 years. It is also possible to receive funding for this, information on which can be found here.</p>

    <p>Solar panels are a reliable, efficient source of zero carbon electricity, they are also low maintenance and silent so they don’t disrupt the running of a business. A solar panel has to be placed very specifically, with no shading whatsoever as this can drastically reduce the electrical output. It is a very effective measure, especially for buildings that are in need of electricity year round.</p>

    <h1>Solar hot water</h1>

    <p>Solar thermal or solar hot water systems work by absorbing energy from the sun and transferring it, using heat exchangers, to heat water. It can be used to provide hot water at temperatures of between 55 and 65ºC. There are three main types of solar heating collector that are suitable for mounting on buildings. The first is Flat-plate collectors; a sheet of black metal that absorbs the sun’s energy encases the collector system. Water is fed through the system in pipes which conduct the heat to the water. Another is Evacuated tubes; a series of parallel glass heat tubes grouped together. Each tube contains an absorber tube. Sunlight passing through the outer glass tube heats the absorber tube contained within it, and in doing so, the heat is transferred to water flowing through the tube. And the last is Solar matting; a range of extruded hollow sections of flexible black material that can be used for solar collection. Water passes through the hollow tubes, absorbing the heat from the sun.</p>

    <p>The cost of measure is medium, with a payback period of 5 to 10 years. These systems are only financially viable in a business with a high demand for hot water.</p>

    <p>Planning permission is not usually needed and these systems can be integrated into an existing gas-boiler system. The business may be able to claim the Government’s Renewable Heat Incentive. An efficient solar heating system can meet up to 60% of a buildings hot water requirements.</p>

                    <p>Combination boilers combine a water heater and central heating boiler into one unit. Unlike boilers with tanks, they produce hot water on demand, giving efficiencies in terms of both energy and water use.</p>

    <h1>Boilers</h1>

    <p>The Combisave device speeds up the heating process, thus reducing wastage. It can be fitted to many combiboilers and can save an average of 27,000 litres of water over a 12 month period.</p>

    <p>A combi-boiler has a medium cost of measure and a combi-save is very low cost to install. A combi-boiler will save space as it does not have a tank, it saves energy and saves water. It can struggle to cope with a high demand for hot water but it is effective.</p>

  <div class="col-full">
    
    <h1>Insulation</h1>

    <p>The building fabric refers to the ceiling, walls, windows, floors and doors of a building. Optimum design of building fabric can minimise potential heating requirements, which may lead to the downsizing of heating systems or sometimes eliminate the need for them at all.</p>

    <p>Typically, two thirds of the heat generated in a building is lost through the building fabric itself. The remaining third is lost through gaps and vents in the fabric which allow warm air to leave and cold air to enter the space (either deliberately through ventilation or uncontrolled through gaps and cracks).</p>

    <p>Therefore increasing insulation properties either with, cavity wall, roof, solid wall or underfloor insulation and controlling air tightness of the building from poorly fitting windows, doors or joins in walls will reduce requirement for mechanical heating. Good opportunities for draught proofing and adding insulation can occur when cladding needs renewing, when windows or doors need replacing, when replacing roofing, and when replacing suspended floors.</p>
