<p class="lead">The Sketchbook Project was a social media campaign to celebrate the latest iteration of this particular website. The goal was to encourage a solid foundation for creative projects, and to essentially give something back to the community.</p>

The project was posted across several channels -- primarily Twitter, Instagram and Dribbble, and covered four articles over two weeks. My role for this project covered everything from copywriting and photography to design, development, and deployment. This resulted in valuable insight to what users respond to, the click-to-read ratio, and underlying success-rate of each article.

The articles were targeting creatives; designers and creators. The most popular article focused on web design and featured a step-by-step tutorial to develop a static online business card -- from the creative process to the finished compiled code. The final template could thus be used by someone with little to no web development knowledge.

I am generally very happy with the outcome. It received good feedback and sparked interesting conversations about the optimal workflow and creative process. It also encouraged me to develop a new worthwhile website, while simultaneously forcing me to share knowledge, which was hopefully beneficial for everyone involved.
