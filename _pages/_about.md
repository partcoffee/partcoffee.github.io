## To do:

* Lag logo
* Hvilke prosjekt vil du presentere?
* Hva skal være fokus på hvert prosjekt? Speed/performance, design, etc.
* Graphics til hvert prosjekt
* Contact form eller bare mailto

## General case study

* Overview: what’s the elevator pitch?
* Problem definition: what’s the problem you were trying to solve? what were the success metrics?
* Audience: who are your target users/audience for the project? Personas go here.
* Team / Role: who did you work with on the project? What was your team structure?
* Constraints: Talk about the constraints; time, access to users, undefined problem
* Design Process: what was your design process? Did you facilitate any design exercises? What deliverables were you responsible for? Speak to messiness.
* Retrospective: did you reach success metrics? Solve the right problem? What would you do better if you could do it again?

This part is really just here to say that I continued the Englishness application from my last semeser. The development of the project <a href="https://magnuss.carbonmade.com/projects/5396219">can be found on my old univeristy portfolio</a>. This article will be short, and I will only focus on what changed from the previous site. The release date is currently unkown.

In order to upload content to the site, I had to explore PHP. PHP is fairly easy, but it's also the first step into computer programming --- a language and syntax very different to scripting languages like JavaScript. At the time of writing, I'm still developing the application, but it's quintessentially allowing uploads to the host server, and dropping said uploads to a dedicated folder, named "Uploads".
