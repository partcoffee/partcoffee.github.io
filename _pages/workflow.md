First off, thank you for your interest in how I work! Secondly, I am Magnus and I moved from design to development as the lacking ability to execute my vision (i.e. design) was killing me. I care about quality and web performance, and I really really don't like bloated code. Anyway, before we start, here's a TL;DR for you:

<blockquote class="entry">
	<p>Sublime Text, Sass, Grunt, Jekyll &mdash; and hard code over CSS frameworks any day</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="div"></div>

With performance in mind, I enjoy the weight of static sites from static site generators. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> is my current favourite. In fact, this site is built with Jekyll for complete control over each individual page without bloat or additional round-trips to a database (because it's not there..) for PHP includes and whatnot.

On the topic of performance, my local development system matters to me too. I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> with <a href="http://emmet.io/" target="_blank">Emmet</a> for speed, and <a href="http://browsersync.io/" target="_blank">BrowserSync</a> for local testing. I don't hold a strong opinion on build systems, but I know how to use them. Jekyll will take care of most of this for me, but for Wordpress development, I am used to Grunt.

Frameworks are great, and while I appreciate the rapid development it unlocks and allows for, I'm not a fan of dumping a massive library to merely use a fraction of it. There are <a href="https://github.com/giakki/uncss" target="_blank">ways around this</a>, but I enjoy being able to identify what each piece of code does, and how it all interacts with each other. Not always possible of course, but appreciated nonetheless.

And that's about it --- feel free to shoot me any questions you may have! I'd be happy to answer, argue and/or fight over the best text editor out there, or why tabs are better than spaces.
