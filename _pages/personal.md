<p class="lead pull" markdown='1'>
	A personal website is something I find myself always wanting to update, as I somehow want it to reflect my latest skills, style and experiences. I believe Anthony Casalena phrased it best by saying "It's like your online clothing."
	<span class="entry">This is version number 16 or something</span>
</p>

I probably have a love&mdash;hate relationship with designing things for myself. In one way the creative freedom is amazing, but it also blurs the line of what "done" means. So this is version number... uh, 16 I think.

The main focus for this site is to give each individual project a place to live and breathe --- like a gallery if you wish, with no distractions or elements to compete for attention. The site is built with the previous website in mind; keeping the good parts, but making it smaller and more user-friendly. We're essentially looking for a blank canvas for each project, suitable for a quick visit or in-depth analysis.

From the previous site we are keeping the focus on typography, while simultaneously removing redundancy. We focus more on visuals for a more pleasant experience, where we can offer something up-front without forcing anyone to read. Yes, I know, it's kind of obvious now in hindsight.

The site is still built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> on top of my own <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/snap" target="_blank">Jekyll boilerplate</a>. We source our typography from <a href="https://typekit.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Typekit</a>, code in Sass, and host everything on <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/partcoffee.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> --- which is all precompiled due to GitHub's plugin policy. This essentially means I can ship a light and static site for free powered by GitHub's hosting.

I also feel in complete control with vanilla Jekyll, and can therefore tweak each individual page or article to look unique without sacrificing performance anywhere. Our performance-budget is a speed index score of less than 1000 on <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">WebPagetest</a>.

For your amusement, I have included a selection of previous designs. As for this site however, the <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/150704_5G_55Z/" target="_blank">performance goal</a> was met and I'm happy with the design --- for now at anyway. I'd be happy to answer any questions or critiques, so shoot me a tweet or something if you want to chat.

It also might be worth checking out the source code if you're into that sort of thing. There may or may not be something worthwhile in there.
