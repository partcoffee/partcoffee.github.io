<p class="lead">
	While studying I had the great opportunity of working for a bespoke software company just north-east of Winchester, developing and designing for print and web.
</p>

<p class="pull">
	Early 2015, I started working as a designer for First Option Software. My role covered design and development for internal and external projects. The latter had a primary focus on Wordpress, giving me the opportunity to work with a varity of frameworks and prototyping tools.
	<span class="entry">Selected clients:<br>Land Rover, Jaguar, Siemens and more.</span>
</p>

I also had the privilege of working in a team actively using the latest industry tools for efficient collaboration. Prototyping and version control was key here, and also made remote work possible when university deadlines started to pile up.

The experience was valuable, and taught me how to work as the most inexperienced person in the room --- and how that's okay too.
