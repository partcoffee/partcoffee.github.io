<p class="lead">The End of Year Show is an annual event held in association with the University of Winchester. It is arranged by the Digital Media students to interact with the industry, secure jobs or potential clients in the future, and essentially kickstart some careers.</p>

The event is arranged by the second year students, and includes branding, venue, design and development as the core jobs. My team had the responsibility for the website, along with brand guidelines and visual design. The theme for this year was Augmented Reality, and the goal was to get in contact with the industry.

My individual role covered development, deployment and visual design. I worked closely with <a href="https://twitter.com/conorcresswell" target="_blank">Conor Cresswell</a>, and together we established a brand and identity for the upcoming event. The website, which was live before, during, and some time after the show, was the result of a lot of coffee and hour-long arguments over what typeface to use.

We killed several ideas along the way, and often complete prototypes as well. From too corporate to too anonymous, we explored everything, and with a year group of over 20 opinionated designers, it was ambitious to represent everyone. We eventually landed a redesign based on the feedback, which managed to satisfy the majority, while still adhering to our business goals and target audience. Given more time I would have loved to have further improved performance, and extended the brand to other platforms with custom visuals and animations.
