This page covers my university portfolio for Spring 2015. The projects overlap at times, and might link to each-other. The projects are unavailable from the main navigation, so this page serves as a hub for all my university projects.

Furthermore, this site is strongly based on feedback from semester 1 --- and while images are still important, the primary focus is to add depth with thorough case studies.
