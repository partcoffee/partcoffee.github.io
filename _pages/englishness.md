<p class="lead">The Englishness Application was a web project for the Parliament of the United Kingdom, allowing the general public to upload videos and images to illustrate their personal definition of what England means to them.</p>

<p class="pull">
	<a href="http://ourengland.org" target="_blank">The application</a> encourages a collaborative approach to national pride the democratic voice. The result is a montage of England defined by the people, and not merely a collection of landmarks and tourist attractions. By making a highly subjective end result, we had to be broad and accept content from anyone and everyone with a smartphone or computer at hand.

My role for this project covered the idea, design, development and deployment, while outsourcing the prototype video and photography. We simply used PHP for uploading content, while keeping everything else static. A style guide was also developed in order to ensure a consistent identity, with the option to scale.

The obvious challenge was the question proposed; how can a confused Norwegian define what it really means to be English? The question is tricky and arguably impossible to answer --- thus our approach gave that power to the user, as one answer could be very different to the next. We also had to take special care with our moving content (video), and decided to not use a video background to prevent motion sickness for example.

The project ran side by side with other important deadlines, and I really wish I could have dedicated more time to it. Performance is something that could be greatly improved, and is definitely something I would like to come back to.
