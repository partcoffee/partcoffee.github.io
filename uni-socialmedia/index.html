My goal was to encourage a solid foundation for new creative projects, and to essentially give something back to the community I’ve been learning so much from over the years. The project was posted across several channels – primarily Twitter, Instagram and Dribbble. The full study, including stats and numbers, can be found on Canvas.</p> <blockquote class="entry"> <p>I wanted to give something back for once, as you guys have given me so much.</p> </blockquote> <p>I identify as an introvert, and I’ve never been the one to put myself out there or shout for attention. Running a social media campaign about myself and what I do was a scary challenge straight away. It was outside my comfort zone, and in a way that’s great — that’s how you learn, expand and grow as a human being. So without any further twittering (hehe), let’s dive into this:</p> <p>I quickly decided to promote myself over another company. This was mainly to practise and make mistakes without affecting another company’s reputation. I also wanted to give something back to the design community I’ve been a part of for so long, but not really contributing much to.</p> <p>The next challenge was probably the hardest; where do I send these people? My website was in a desperate need of an update as it had little to no content, and I had to get a new one up by the launch date. I managed to hit the deadline with a few days to spare, and I wrote <a href="/uni-website" class="mark">a full case-study on the making of the site</a> as well. I’d argue that this was the hardest part of this project, but probably not the most time-consuming.</p> <p>Along with the website, I developed an action plan to follow for the duration of the campaign. The plan can be found in full on Canvas, but to I essentially set off two days a week to post new content.</p> <p><img src="../img/animation/img-11.jpg" alt="Pencil" class="wide cover" /></p> <h2 id="running-it">Running it</h2> <p>The campaign featured four posts on the benefits of sketching. With two posts a week, I had little time to create and proofread content along with work and other university projects. My only guess would be that it would be easier to run a campaign as a full-time job or as a team.</p> <p>For the first two weeks, <a href="/uni-workflow/#priorities" class="mark">this project was my top priority</a>, dedicated to creating content, taking pictures and fixing bugs. As the site was still new and lacking rich content, I had to adapt the design along the way — a primariy example of this would be the addition of video support my second post, as I simply hadn’t considered that particular element in the initial design process.</p> <p>The campaign also featured a prize for sharing my content. This was encouraged at the top and bottom of each article, but I still question how effective that was. In the last couple of weeks, I encouraged retweets over sharing, which got a much higher response than physically clicking a link on the website itself. <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare/status/582486905234841600" target="_blank" class="mark">The winner was announced March 30</a>.</p> <h2 id="reward">Reward</h2> <p>Let’s start with the quantitative results: I certainly gained followers and likes from this campaign, and achieved a read-ratio (people who read the article after clicking it) of 80% on Medium. This is good, and I expected less to be honest, and it also drove some traffic to my website as well. The biggest referral site was Dribbble due to their design-focused users, followed by Facebook, organic Google Search and Twitter, which in total resulted in over 10 000 new page views.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the homepage was the most popular page. This was followed by the first, third and second post – suggesting that the fourth post was not as valuable as the others. I sort of agree with this, and I believe the campaign could have ended on part three.</p> <p>What I care most about however, is the qualitative results. After publishing <a href="/sketchbook-3">part three</a>, I received several messages thanking me for the article. It was heart-warming, and made it obvious that giving people something less abstract to work with was preferred.</p> <h2 id="reflection-and-conclusion">Reflection and conclusion</h2> <p>I’m happy with the campaign, but I believe it could have been executed better given more time. I received good feedback on my code in part three and overall photography — I even had people ask me to post more on Instagram because they enjoyed flicking through pictures. Just posting pretty stuff was a part of my initial ideas, but it was lacking a “hook”. However, consistently posting remarkable stuff can apparently be a hook in itself, as demonstrated by people like <a href="https://instagram.com/alexstrohl/" target="_blank">Alex Strohl</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/lauri_laukkanen/" target="_blank">Lauri Laukkanen</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/jaredchambers/" target="_blank">Jared Chambers</a>.</p> <p>I discovered how important regularly posted content is, and how you can’t afford a drop in quality. You’ve got less than 10 seconds to grab somebody’s attention, and you need to be spectacular or unique in some way to make your content worth their time. For me, this would translate to posts around 2-3 minutes, but much heavier on the photography. People scan more often than they read, and pictures are a lot easier to scan than paragraphs.</p> <p>In conclusion, I’m happy with the outcome. I have a new website, I got my name out there, I obtained some new followers outside my friends and family, and I had some interesting conversations with them.</p> </article> <footer> <a href="/uni/" class="nxt"> Back to projects </a> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee" target="_blank">GitHub</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="http://instagram.com/magnusskare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> </li> <li>&#124;</li> <li> <a href="mailto:website.magnusskare@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a> </li> <li> <a href="/">Copyright 2015 Magnus Skare</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/partcoffee.github.io/commits/master" target="_blank">Revised: 31 Mar 2015</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src='../js/main.js'></script> </div> </div>
