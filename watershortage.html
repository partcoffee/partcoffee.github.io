    <h1>Water shortage</h1>

    <p>Water resources are under an increasing pressure and have become the third biggest risk in this sector.</p>

    <p>Buildings will need to become increasingly more water efficient as changes in water availability, particularly reductions in the summer, may lead to a less reliable supply. In future years a large number of people will live in areas of the UK affected by water supply-demand deficits. To help your business and your area, implementing simple measures to reduce the use of water will benefit you greatly. There are a number of simple yet effective ways to reduce the amount of water used.</p>

    <h1>Leak detection</h1>

    <p>A leak detection system is used in buildings to help detect a water leak and to prevent the loss of property from water damage. You can get different systems for this. Flow based systems detect the flow of water passing through a pipe, and can automatically switch off the water should a leak occur. Sensor based single-zone system is for water leak detection for individual areas where the presence of unwanted water. Sensor based multi-zone system is used for large areas or multiple rooms and can be monitored using a single alarm panel with a multi-zone capability.</p>

    <p>It can be expensive to install these systems, however, having these systems in place can help to save money from undetected leaks and help your building meet certain water detection and prevention requirements, they can be used in any building.</p>

    <h1>Water efficient taps</h1>

    <p>To reduce the amount of water used, water efficient taps can be brought as a unit or can be retrofitted; there are 3 main types of taps that can also be retrofitted. Aerated taps and flow regulated taps can save up to 10 litres of water per minutes with no splashing they come in various sizes and flow rates, standard aerators do not regulate pressure, nor do flow regulated taps and with the flow regulated, there can be blockage due to scale build up. Auto stop taps release limited amount of water per use and close automatically. The savings with these can vary and the mechanism can jam. Retrofit is available for each of these taps.</p>

    <h1>Rain water harvesting</h1>

    <p>Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and deposition of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the aquifer. Tanks and filtration systems are installed on the roof of buildings to catch and cleanse water, filtration tanks can also be installed underground. Harvested rainwater can be used for WC flushing, irrigation and cooling. Costs of installing rainwater harvesting systems vary depending on the size of the building and system required. However, it will be cheaper to install a system during the building process, rather than retrofitting. Payback periods also vary, however, in some cases it can be as short as 3 – 5 years, particularly in larger commercial buildings.</p>

    <h1>Grey water harvesting</h1>

    <p>Greywater harvesting involves recycling wastewater generated from washing (including laundry and dishwashers), for uses such as WC flushing, landscape irrigation and constructed wetlands. Ideal buildings for greywater recycling are hotels, student accommodation or high rise structures with living accommodation. These buildings provide high system efficiency as the bath and shower water provides a constant supply that is reused for WC flushing. Information in payback periods for greywater recycling are difficult to source, as these are not as popular as rainwater systems. In addition, in many cases the rise in water efficiency measures being fitted in buildings means that there is less grey water available for recycling.</p>
