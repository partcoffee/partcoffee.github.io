    <h1>Heating</h1>

    <p>Temperatures are projected to rise, this poses risks to health and wellbeing and increases the demand for energy for summer cooling.</p>

    <p>The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, caused when heat is absorbed and then slowly released by hard surfaces, is already observed around the country and is predicted to push urban temperatures even higher. For example analysis suggests that, energy demand for cooling could triple between 2010 and 2050. Now is a strategic time to put in place measures to keep your buildings cool so that you benefit from long term savings.</p>

    <h1>Solar shading</h1>

    <p>The purpose of solar shading is to reduce the thermal heat gain in a building as well as controlling the levels of direct light. This can be provided by a number ways. The first is Overhangs, another is Awnings. Light shelves are another method, they are similar to overhangs and awnings but are installed half way up a window, typically above head height. The top shelf reflects extra daylight into the building without glare and without compromising shading. You can also install external or internal blinds for more control of shading.</p>

    <p>Overhangs and light shelves have a medium to high cost of measure, whereas internal and external blinds have a low to medium cost of measure.</p>

    <p>These methods all allow normal use of windows and are easy to retrofit, and the non-automated systems are low maintenance. However the automated systems have a high maintenance cost.</p>

    <h1>Cooling building fabrics</h1>

    <p>The building fabric refers to the ceiling, walls, windows, floors and doors of a building. Optimum design of building fabric can minimise potential cooling requirements, which may lead to the downsizing of cooling systems or sometimes eliminate the need for them at all. There a multiple ways of achieving this. Having operable windows and doors creates natural and cross ventilation, this has a low cost or no cost at all. Operable natural ventilation shafts also create natural and cross ventilation, this will have a low to medium cost measure.</p>

                    <p>Although it has a high cost to implement, there is little upkeep and a green space helps your building in a number of areas. Green roofs, living roofs and brown roofs are and will be an increasingly important technology.</p>

                    <p>You can implement green walls or roofs to reduce solar absorption, this has a high cost measure but it is incredibly efficient. It will also help with matters such as flooding as it provides soakaway for the building, reducing flood water.</p>
