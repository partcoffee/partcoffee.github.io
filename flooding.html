    <h1>Flooding</h1>

    <p>Flooding is one of the highest risks for the built environment.</p>

    <p>It is expected to become more common throughout the twenty-first century. This will impact on both residential and public buildings and have impacts on service delivery and costs for clean-up and repair. There are many measures you can implement to save future clean-up and repair costs, these are identified on this page. Taking these precautions saves time and money in the future and will help keep your business running smoothly even during floods.</p>

                    <p>Raising plug sockets to at least 1.5m high to be an appropriate height above flood levels is effective and inexpensive compared to the cost of repairs. Electrics should be above flood levels to avoid extra repair costs.</p>

    <h1>Flood resilient finishes</h1>

    <p>There are a range of building and finishing materials which can contribute towards protecting the building from flood damage. To decrease recovery times after flooding has taken place horizontal plasterboard, or lime-based plaster instead of gypsum plaster can be used. Tiled flooring with appropriate grouting will mean that flooring and carpets may not have to be replaced. Fit water-resistant skirting boards, or treat them on all sides. Use water resistant materials in kitchen and bathroom areas such as stainless steel, plastic or solid wood rather than chipboard. Raise key equipment on to plinths, and raise door thresholds to keep shallow water out.</p>

    <p>You can also use Tanking, this is the application of a layer of material to a wall or floor to increase its resistance to water entry. Materials used can include: liquid membranes, polymer or cement coatings. When it comes to electricity and gas, consider moving the ground floor ring main cables to first floor level with drop down cables to ground floor sockets. Sockets should also be raised to an appropriate height above flood levels. Gas meters can be raised above the expected flood levels during refurbishment works.</p>

    <p>The cost of these finishes ranges from high to low depending on a number of factors, moving electrical components is very low in cost, especially compared to the cost of fixing it if it was affected by flooding. These finishes will usually need a qualified professional for installation.</p>

                    <p>These are simple to install and can last for around 25 years, putting flood guards and other measures in place before a flood can save a lot of money in repairs. Having these measures in place can also lower you building's insurance.</p>

    <h1>Flood guards</h1>

    <p>These flood proof measures are designed to protect buildings and its contents from being damaged by flood water. There are three types of flood guards that can be fitted to doors; demountable, automatic and permanent. Demountable door guards are fitted in front of doors to resist flooding and can also be fitted to windows. Automatic doors deploy even when there is no one in the building. Permanent door guards are additional doors with seals and locks to prevent the building from being flooded.</p>

    <p>Water doors are mountable and demountable flood protection barriers that can be fitted in front of doors, gates or openings. They work by having fixed posts at either side of the area being protected and fixed protective caps that are in the floor. Flood gates are adjustable gates that are used to protect the boundary of the property. These both have a lifetime guarantee.</p>

    <p>The cost of these flood proof measures is medium to high depending on which measure you are installing. Having these measures will avoid damage to buildings and content and it can reduce building insurance rates.</p>

    <h1>Air bricks</h1>

    <p>Air Brick Covers are designed to prevent water from entering a building via airbricks, which allow air to circulate through the building. Air brick covers seal the airbrick and stop flood water from entering. Ordinary clay or plastic air bricks can be replaced with an automatic, self-sealing air brick. Designed to replace a standard airbrick it allows air to freely pass through the building, but as flood water rises, a hinged door within the air brick closes and seals off the apertures. When the flood water recedes, the hinged door returns to its original position allowing air to circulate once again.</p>

    <p>Air bricks are low cost, however the cost to install them may vary, and they do not need a builder or specialist to install them. They must be removed after a flood to prevent damp. They are effective for both river and flash floods of up to 300m.</p>

                    <p>Permeable paving is a paving system made from sustainable and porous material that allows rainwater and other surface water to be absorbed and move through its base and sub base, therefore reducing the amount of runoff.</p>

    <h1>Soak away</h1>

    <p>A soakaway is a drainage system that is a hole in the ground that is filled with gravel/ hard-core where rainwater and other wastewater drains slowly into the ground. Green roofs also provide soakaway as well as helping your building in many other ways.</p>

    <p>Both of these measures’ initial outlay can be expensive, depending on the size of the area and material used and they are not suitable for poor draining soils and they can increase the risks of groundwater pollution. However, there is minimal net land take, they provide groundwater recharge, and have good volume reduction and peak flow attenuation. As well as a good community acceptability, they are easy to construct and operate and can be retrofitted, and most importantly, they very effectively help floodwater recede more quickly.</p>

  <div class="col-full">
    
    <h1>Non-return valves</h1>

    <p>Sewage backflow can cause a great deal of damage resulting in long term consequences and high clean up expenses. Non-return valves can be fitted to drainage systems to allow waste water and solids to flow freely and unrestricted during normal circumstances, however once water surges back through the drainage system during a flood event, a gate within the valve is automatically shut through the hydraulic pressure of the flood water. When searching for flood protection products, look for the British Standards Institute Kitemark symbol.</p>

    <p>This has a medium cost of measure, between £50 and £500 not including installation. Non-return valves prevent damage and contamination from foul water and sewerage and also prevents rodents entering the building through pipes. It may increase risks to neighbouring buildings if they are not fitted with similar measures.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="col-full">
    
    <h1>Oil receptors and separators</h1>

    <p>An oil separator, separates oil from water from fuel spillage and other contaminates, where it is retained safety until removed. These are usually fitted to surface water drainage systems to help protect the environment and the reuse of the water. This is to help reduce pollution.</p>

    <p>It has a medium to high cost of measure depending on the size of the unit. It will help save money, it reuses water, and is less of a pollutant to the environment. However, it is costly to maintain and needs to be properly managed otherwise it can lead to polluting surface and ground water.</p>
